# I started coding using arduino uno
I started with my first Arduino project by creating a traffic signal system. After that, I worked on a project to make an LED fade on and off. Finally, I developed a basic car reverse system using an ultrasonic sensor and a buzzer, which detects obstacles behind the car and sounds an alarm that gets louder as the object gets closer.
